gsscrapp is a Google Store ScraPer (don't ask me where the second "P" came
from...)

The purpose of this small program is to use the google [Places API][1] to scrape
data from google's database about different stores in the United States.

At the moment, it is hard-coded to search for "Board Game" stores, but this can
be changed easily (and maybe I'll add a configuration option)
